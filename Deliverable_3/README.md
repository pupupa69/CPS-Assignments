# 16x16 Grid generation and Path finding algorithm

## Summary
<br />

Available grid generation methods:  
- Random world generator  
- Slightly smarter world generator  
<br />

Available start/finish selection methods:  
- Two random points  
- Random points from either edges of the world  
- Enter your own points manually  
- Pick the points on the map  
<br />

Path finding algorithm:
- A* search  
<br />

Imported libraries:  
- matplotlib
- numpy
- math, random, heapq (available by default)
<br />

## How to run

Simply run main.py
``` 
python main.py
```
Make sure the path_find.py and path_gen.py are located in the same folder as main.py!

1. This program will first show the generated grid.  
2. Then, you will be able to select your own start and finish  points by clicking on the corresponding tiles on the plot.  
3. You will see the shortest path generated by A* algorithm.  
4. You will then be able to block a white tile by double clicking on its position. The shortest path will be rerouted if any path tile is blocked.  
5. If there is no path available, the program will exit.
